# `isRedirect` function

The `isRedirect` function can be used to determine if an object is a redirect object.

### Options

#### `obj`

- The object to check
- Required

### Returns

#### `true` if the object is a redirect object

#### `false` if the object is not a redirect object

### Examples

```tsx
import { isRedirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function somewhere(obj: unknown) {
  if (isRedirect(obj)) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

# `RouteOptions` type

The `RouteOptions` type is used to describe the options that can be used when creating a route.

### Properties

#### `getParentRoute`

- Type: `() => TParentRoute`
- Required
- A function that returns the parent route of the route being created. This is required to provide full type safety to child route configurations and to ensure that the route tree is built correctly.

#### `path`

- Type: `string`
- Required, unless an `id` is provided to configure the route as a layout route
- The path segment that will be used to match the route.

#### `id`

- Type: `string`
- Optional, but required if a `path` is not provided
- The unique identifier for the route if it is to be configured as a layout route. If provided, the, the route will not match against the location pathname and its routes will be flattened into its parent route for matching.

#### `validateSearch`

- Type: `(rawSearchParams: unknown) => TSearchSchema`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when this route is matched and passed the raw search params from the current location and return valid parsed search params. If this function throws, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If this function does not throw, its return value will be used as the route's search params and the return type will be inferred into the rest of the router.

#### `parseParams`

- Type: `(rawParams: Record<string, string>) => TParams`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when this route is matched and passed the raw params from the current location and return valid parsed params. If this function throws, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If this function does not throw, its return value will be used as the route's params and the return type will be inferred into the rest of the router.

#### `stringifyParams`

- Type: `(params: TParams) => Record<string, string>`
- Required if `parseParams` is provided
- A function that will be called when this routes parsed params are being used to build a location. This function should return a valid object of `Record<string, string>` mapping.

#### `beforeLoad`

```tsx
type beforeLoad = (
  opts: RouteMatch & {
    search: TFullSearchSchema
    abortController: AbortController
    preload: boolean
    params: TAllParams
    context: TParentContext
    location: ParsedLocation
    navigate: NavigateFn<AnyRoute>
    buildLocation: BuildLocationFn<AnyRoute>
    cause: 'enter' | 'stay'
  },
) => Promise<TRouteContext> | TRouteContext | void
```

- Optional
- This async function is called before a route is loaded. If an error is thrown here, the route's loader will not be called and the route will not render. If thrown during a navigation, the navigation will be cancelled and the error will be passed to the `onError` function. If thrown during a preload event, the error will be logged to the console and the preload will fail.
- If this function returns a promise, the route will be put into a pending state and cause rendering to suspend until the promise resolves. If this routes pendingMs threshold is reached, the `pendingComponent` will be shown until it resolved. If the promise rejects, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render.
- If this function returns a `TRouteContext` object, that object will be merged into the route's context and be made available in the `loader` and other related route components/methods.
- It's common to use this function to check if a user is authenticated and redirect them to a login page if they are not. To do this, you can either return or throw a `redirect` object from this function.

#### `loader`

```tsx
type loader = (
  opts: RouteMatch & {
    search: TFullSearchSchema
    abortController: AbortController
    preload: boolean
    params: TAllParams
    context: TAllContext
    location: ParsedLocation
    navigate: NavigateFn<AnyRoute>
    buildLocation: BuildLocationFn<AnyRoute>
    cause: 'enter' | 'stay'
  },
) => Promise<TLoaderData> | TLoaderData | void
```

- Optional
- This async function is called when a route is matched and passed the route's match object. If an error is thrown here, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If thrown during a navigation, the navigation will be cancelled and the error will be passed to the `onError` function. If thrown during a preload event, the error will be logged to the console and the preload will fail.
- If this function returns a promise, the route will be put into a pending state and cause rendering to suspend until the promise resolves. If this routes pendingMs threshold is reached, the `pendingComponent` will be shown until it resolved. If the promise rejects, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render.
- If this function returns a `TLoaderData` object, that object will be stored on the route match until the route match is no longer active. It can be accessed using the `useLoaderData` hook in any component that is a child of the route match before another `<Outlet />` is rendered.

#### `loaderDeps`

- Type: `(opts: { search: TFullSearchSchema; location: ParsedLocation, context: TAllContext }) => Record<string, any>`
- Optional
- A function that will be called before this route is matched to provide additional unique identification to the route match and serve as a dependency tracker for when the match should be reloaded. It should return any serializable value that can uniquely identify the route match from navigation to navigation.
- By default, path params are already used to uniquely identify a route match, so it's unnecessary to return these here.
- If your route match relies on search params or context values for unique identification, it's required that you return them here so they can be made available in the `loader`'s `deps` argument.

#### `staleTime`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultStaleTime`, which defaults to `0`
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be considered fresh. If a route match is matched again within this time frame, its loader data will not be reloaded.

#### `preloadStaleTime`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime`, which defaults to `30_000` ms (30 seconds)
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be considered fresh when preloading. If a route match is preloaded again within this time frame, its loader data will not be reloaded. If a route match is loaded (for navigation) within this time frame, the normal `staleTime` is used instead.

#### `gcTime`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultGcTime`, which defaults to 30 minutes.
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be kept in memory after a preload or it is no longer in use.

#### `shouldReload`

- Type: `boolean | ((args: LoaderArgs) => boolean)`
- Optional
- If `false` or returns `false`, the route match's loader data will not be reloaded on subsequent matches.
- If `true` or returns `true`, the route match's loader data will be reloaded on subsequent matches.
- If `undefined` or returns `undefined`, the route match's loader data will adhere to the default stale-while-revalidate behavior.

#### `caseSensitive`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- If `true`, this route will be matched as case-sensitive

#### `wrapInSuspense`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- If `true`, this route will be forcefully wrapped in a suspense boundary, regardless if a reason is found to do so from inspecting its provided components.

#### `pendingMs`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPendingMs`, which defaults to `1000`
- The threshold in milliseconds that a route must be pending before its `pendingComponent` is shown.

#### `pendingMinMs`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPendingMinMs` which defaults to `500`
- The minimum amount of time in milliseconds that the pending component will be shown for if it is shown. This is useful to prevent the pending component from flashing on the screen for a split second.

#### `preloadMaxAge`

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `30_000` ms (30 seconds)
- The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that a route's preloaded route data will be cached for. If a route is not matched within this time frame, its loader data will be discarded.

#### `preSearchFilters`

- Type: `((search: TFullSearchSchema) => TFullSearchSchema)[]`
- Optional
- An array of functions that will be called when generating any new links to this route or its grandchildren.
- Each function will be called with the current search params and should return a new search params object that will be used to generate the link.
- It has a `pre` prefix because it is called before the user-provided function that is passed to `navigate`/`Link` etc has a chance to modify the search params.

#### `postSearchFilters`

- Type: `((search: TFullSearchSchema) => TFullSearchSchema)[]`
- Optional
- An array of functions that will be called when generating any new links to this route or its grandchildren.
- Each function will be called with the current search params and should return a new search params object that will be used to generate the link.
- It has a `post` prefix because it is called after the user-provided function that is passed to `navigate`/`Link` etc has modified the search params.

#### `onError`

- Type: `(error: unknown) => void`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when an error is thrown during a navigation or preload event.

```tsx
import { Router } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = new Router({
  // ...
  Wrap: ({ children }) => {
    return <MyContext.Provider value={myContext}>{children}</MyContext>
  },
})
```

#### `InnerWrap`

- Type: `React.Component`
- Optional
- A component that will be used to wrap the inner contents of the router. This is useful for providing a context to the inner contents of the router where you also need access to the router context and hooks.

**Example**

```tsx
import { Router } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = new Router({
  // ...
  InnerWrap: ({ children }) => {
    const routerState = useRouterState()

    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={myContext}>
        {children}
      </MyContext>
    )
  },
})
```

#### `notFoundRoute`

- Type: `NotFoundRoute`
- Optional
- A route that will be used as the default not found route for every branch of the route tree. This can be overridden on a per-branch basis by providing a not found route to the `NotFoundRoute` option on the root route of the branch.

# `RouterState` type

The `RouterState` type contains all of the properties that are available on the router state.

### Properties

#### `status`

- Type: `'pending' | 'idle'`
- The current status of the router. If the router is pending, it means that it is currently loading a route or the router is still transitioning to the new route.

#### `isLoading`

- Type: `boolean`
- `true` if the router is currently loading a route or waiting for a route to finish loading.

#### `isTransitioning`

- Type: `boolean`
- `true` if the router is currently transitioning to a new route.

#### `matches`

- Type: `RouteMatch[]`
- An array of all of the route matches that have been resolved and are currently active.

#### `pendingMatches`

- Type: `RouteMatch[]`
- An array of all of the route matches that are currently pending.

#### `location`

- Type: `ParsedLocation`
- The latest location that the router has parsed from the browser history. This location may not be resolved and loaded yet.

#### `resolvedLocation`

- Type: `ParsedLocation`
- The location that the router has resolved and loaded.

#### `lastUpdated`

- Type: `number`
- The timestamp of the last time the router was resolved.

# `RouterEvents` type

The `RouterEvents` type contains all of the events that the router can emit.

### Properties

Each property on this type is an event that the router can emit. The value of each property is an object that contains the following properties:

#### `type`

- Type: `onBeforeLoad | onLoad | onResolved`
- The type of the event
- This is useful for discriminating between events in a listener function

#### `fromLocation`

- Type: `ParsedLocation`
- The location that the router is transitioning from

#### `toLocation`

- Type: `ParsedLocation`
- The location that the router is transitioning to

#### `pathChanged`

#### `state`

- Type: `RouterState`
- The current state of the router

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **`router.state` is always up to date, but NOT REACTIVE. If you use `router.state` in a component, the component will not re-render when the router state changes. To get a reactive version of the router state, use the `useRouterState` hook.**

#### `subscribe`

- Type: `(eventType: TType, fn: ListenerFn<RouterEvents[TType]>) => (event: RouterEvent) => void`
- Subscribes to a router event

- Matches a pathname and search params against the router's route tree and returns an array of route matches
- If `opts.throwOnError` is `true`, any errors that occur during the matching process will be thrown (in addition to being returned in the route match's `error` property).

#### `cancelMatch`

- Type: `(matchId: string) => void`
- Cancels a route match that is currently pending by calling `match.abortController.abort()`.

#### `cancelMatches`

- Type: `() => void`
- Cancels all route matches that are currently pending by calling `match.abortController.abort()` on each one.

#### `buildLocation`

Builds a new parsed location object that can be used later to navigate to a new location.

- Type: `(opts: BuildNextOptions) => ParsedLocation`

  - `search`
    - Type: `true | Updater<unknown>`
    - Optional
    - If `true`, the current search params will be used. If a function is provided, it will be called with the current search params and the return value will be used.
  - `hash`
    - Type: `true | Updater<string>`
    - Optional
    - If `true`, the current hash will be used. If a function is provided, it will be called with the current hash and the return value will be used.
  - `state`
    - Type: `true | NonNullableUpdater<HistoryState>`
    - Optional

      - If `true`, the route mask will be removed when the page is reloaded. This can be overridden on a per-navigation basis by setting the `unmaskOnReload` option in the `Navigate` options.

#### `commitLocation`

Commits a new location object to the browser history.

- Type
  ```tsx
  type commitLocation = (
    location: ParsedLocation & {
      replace?: boolean
      resetScroll?: boolean
      startTransition?: boolean
    },
  ) => Promise<void>
  ```
- Properties
  - `location`
    - Type: `ParsedLocation`
    - Required
    - The location to commit to the browser history
  - `replace`
    - Type: `boolean`
    - Optional
    - Defaults to `false`
    - If `true`, the location will be committed to the browser history using `history.replace` instead of `history.push`
  - `resetScroll`
    - Type: `boolean`
    - Optional
    - Defaults to `true` so that the scroll position will be reset to 0,0 after the location is committed to the browser history.
    - If `false`, the scroll position will not be reset to 0,0 after the location is commited to history.
  - `startTransition`
    - Type: `boolean`
    - Optional
    - Defaults to `true`, so that the router will apply the commit wrapped in a React `startTransition` call.
    - If `false`, the router will not wrap the commit in a React `startTransition` call.

#### `navigate`

Navigates to a new location.

- Type
  ```tsx
  type navigate = (options: NavigateOptions) => Promise<void>
  ```

#### `invalidate`

Invalidates all route matches by forcing their `beforeLoad` and `load` functions to be called again.

- Type: `() => void`
- This is useful any time your loader data might possibly be out of date or stale. For example, if you have a route that displays a list of posts, and you have a loader function that fetches the list of posts from an API, you might want to invalidate the route matches for that route any time a new post is created so that the list of posts is always up to date.

#### `load`

Loads all of the currently matched route matches and resolves when they are all loaded and ready to be rendered.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **`router.load()` respects `route.staleTime` and will not forcefully reload a route match if it is still fresh. If you need to forcefully reload a route match, use `router.invalidate()` instead.**

- Type: `() => Promise<void>`
- The most common use case for this method is to call it when doing SSR to ensure that all of the critical data for the current route is loaded before attempting to stream or render the application to the client.

#### `preloadRoute`

Preloads all of the matches that match the provided `NavigateOptions`.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Preloaded route matches are not stored long-term in the router state. They are only stored until the next attempted navigation action.**

- Type: `(opts?: NavigateOptions) => Promise<RouteMatch[]>`
- Properties
  - `opts`
    - Type: `NavigateOptions`
    - Optional, defaults to the current location
    - The options that will be used to determine which route matches to preload
- Returns
  - A promise that resolves with an array of all of the route matches that were preloaded

#### `matchRoute`

Matches a pathname and search params against the router's route tree and returns a route match's params or false if no match was found.

- Type: `(dest: ToOptions, matchOpts?: MatchRouteOptions) => RouteMatch | false`
- Properties
  - `dest`

    - Options that will be used to match the destination
- Returns
  - A route match object if a match was found
  - `false` if no match was found

    - Type: `string | (() => Promise<string> | string)`
    - Required
    - The HTML to inject into the DOM
    - If a function is provided, it will be called and the resolved value will be injected into the DOM

#### `dehydrateData`
