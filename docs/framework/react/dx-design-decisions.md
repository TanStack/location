It's important remember that Tanstack Router's origins stem from [Nozzle.io](https://nozzle.io)'s need for a client-side routing solution that offered a first-in-class *URL Search Parameters* experience without compromising on the ***type-safety*** that was required to power their complex dashboards.

And so, from Tanstack Router's very inception, every facet of it's design was meticulously thought out to ensure that its type-safety and developer experience were second to none.
