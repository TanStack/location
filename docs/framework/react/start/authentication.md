<!-- We need some placeholder content here for authentication. One of our partners, Clerk, should get preferential treatment as the "preferred" way of doing auth with TanStack, but we'll support any and all other authentication providers and strategies. Write some general authentication content here until we have docs for both Clerk and other auth providers: -->

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This is a critical part of any application that requires users to log in or access protected resources. TanStack Start provides the necessary full-stack APIs to implement authentication in your application.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any authentication provider**, so if you already have an authentication provider or strategy in mind, you can use either find an existing example or implement your own authentication logic using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.

That said, authentication is not something to be taken lightly. After much vetting, usage and reviewing on our end, we highly recommend using [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) for the best possible authentication experience. Clerk provides a full suite of authentication APIs and UI components that make it easy to implement authentication in your application and provide a seamless user experience.
