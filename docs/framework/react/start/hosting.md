Hosting is the process of deploying your application to the internet so that users can access it. This is a critical part of any web development project, ensuring your application is available to the world. TanStack Start is built on [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), a powerful server toolkit for deploying web applications anywhere. Nitro allows TanStack Start to provide a unified API for SSR, streaming, and hydration on any hosting provider.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any hosting provider**, so if you already have a hosting provider in mind, you can deploy your application there using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.

However, since hosting is one of the most crucial aspects of your application's performance, reliability, and scalability, we highly recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=tanstack) for the best possible hosting experience.

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> The page is still a work in progress. We'll keep updating this page with guides on deployment to different hosting providers soon!

When a TanStack Start application is being deployed, the `deployment.preset` value in the `app.config.ts` file determines the deployment target. The deployment target can be set to one of the following values:

- [`vercel`](#vercel): Deploy to Vercel
- [`cloudflare-pages`](#cloudflare-pages): Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- [`netlify`](#netlify): Deploy to Netlify
- [`node-server`](#nodejs): Deploy to a Node.js server
- [`bun`](#bun): Deploy to a Bun server
- ... and more to come!

Choose the deployment target that best suits your needs and follow the deployment guidelines below to deploy your TanStack Start application to your preferred hosting provider.

### Vercel

Deploying your TanStack Start application to Vercel is easy and straightforward. Just set the `deployment.preset` value to `vercel` in your `app.config.ts` file, and you're ready to deploy your application to Vercel.

```ts

import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  deployment: {
    preset: 'vercel',
  },
})
```

Deploy you application to Vercel and you're ready to go!

node .output/server/index.mjs
```

### Bun

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the Bun specific deployment guidelines only work with React 19. If you are using React 18, please refer to the [Node.js](#nodejs) deployment guidelines.

Make sure that your `react` and `react-dom` packages are set to version 19.0.0 or higher in your `package.json` file. If not, run the following command to upgrade the packages:

```sh
npm install react@rc react-dom@rc
```

Set the `deployment.preset` value to `bun` in your `app.config.ts` file, and you're ready to deploy your application to a Node.js server.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  deployment: {
    preset: 'bun',
  },
})
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
bun run build
```

Once the build is complete, you can start your application by running:

```sh
bun run .output/server/index.mjs
```
